### My collection of lab solutions ...  
- My intention is to present you a example to topics covered using past examples.
- Everyweek I will put the questions for corresponding week from last year.
- I will update the codes weekly.
- Best way for you to benefit from it will be using it to comparing it with your solutions to see alternative ways or working solutions from a peer of yours so feel free to check it or play with it afterwards the lab session.
- Last year we used jupyter notebook so the files are not regular '.py' files but '.ipynb' files that requires *"anaconda"* to run.
> the code itself is totally same with python though you can just copy paste into your editor.
- *Solutions might be flawed* occasionally. Also don't just copy paste as it doesn't teach you anything
